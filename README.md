# travelbot

Welcome to the **travelbot** repository. 

This travel bot allows the user to query weather details for the coming 5 days as extracted via the Openweather API.


Examples:

What is the forecast for Birmingham tomorrow?  
On June 23 , what is the outlook for Stonehenge?  
What is the forecast for the Cotswolds, Cumbria and Bristol on June 23?  
Can you tell me the weather forecast for Birmingham for today, tomorrow and 2 days time?  
What is the outlook for Birmingham today and Cambridge tomorrow?  

The app parses the user's request.  
Locations and dates are extracted from the request.  

Therefore, the above ‘chatty’ request examples can optionally be made ‘shorthand’ like this:

Birmingham tomorrow
June 23 Stonehenge
The Cotswolds Cumbria Bristol June 23
Birmingham today tomorrow 2 days time
